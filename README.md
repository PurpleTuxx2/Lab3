# Lab3

Currently this lab is having an issue with creating a UIImageView outlet connecting the AlbumCell view to the AlbumCell.swift file. I have checked to make sure that the Class and Identifier are both named properly as well as ensuring no prior connections exist. I am still working on figuring out the issue, however.
